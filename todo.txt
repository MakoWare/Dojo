Why have I continued down this rabbit hole of bullshit. 

This project was doomed before it started. 

Reasons to quit (highest importance to lowest)

1. I don't enjoy working on it. 

2. There is still a lot of tedious work to be done.

3. All of this code may just go into the trash. 

4. Neil has not and probably will not contribute any code that we will use. 

Reasons to stay on 

1. Could actually work (one day)

2. Invested 6 months of my life in a basement 

3. Feel bad for Derek
